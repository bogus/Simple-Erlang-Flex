This example demonstrates a very simple application with Flex and Erlang.

Used Erlang modules are these:

erlang-http
erlang-amf
mnesia

Download erlang-http and erlang-amf from github and install them appropriately.
Then change HTTPDIR variable in Makefile. Change this directory to your erlang-http package
directory. 

Then run these commands:

$ make 
$ make run

After running "make run" command in erl shell type

storage_manager:start().

to run mnesia.
